                            Free Pascal Compiler

                               Version 1.0.10


****************************************************************************
* Introduction
****************************************************************************

This package contains a freeware 32-bit pascal compiler for Intel 80386 and
compatibles as well as for Motorola 68020 and compatibles. The language
and the runtime library are more or less compatible to TP 7.0. Some Delphi
additions have also been implemented like classes, exceptions, ansistrings
and rtti.

Free Pascal is currently available for the following platforms:
- DOS, via the DJ Delorie's GO32V2 Dos extenders
- Linux (i386 and m68k), ELF format
- OS/2 & DOS, via the EMX extender
- Win32 (Win32s, Win95/98/Me/XP/2000 and WinNT)
- Sun Solaris i386
- BeOS i386
- QNX i386
- FreeBSD i386
- NetBSD i386
- Commodore Amiga classic


More platforms will be supported in the future.

****************************************************************************

Download dos1010.zip (version for DOS) or w321010.zip (version for
Win9x/NT) or os21010.zip (EMX version - for OS/2 and DOS) and unzip it
into a temporary directory.

Start the install program INSTALL.EXE and follow the instructions.

Don't forget to set the path as mentioned by the install program.

To test the compiler, change to the demo directory of the compiler
and type
        ppc386 hello
        hello

****************************************************************************
* Documentation
****************************************************************************

The documentation is available as HTML pages, PDF, PS, and text although the
recommended format is pdf. These are all available on
ftp://ftp.freepascal.org/fpc/docs

NB that there is at present no FPC specific documentation for the Win32
system functions. There is a note in the ftp /doc explaining where
the MS help file for this can be obtained.

Suggestions, Help ...
---------------------
e-mail: fpc-devel@lists.freepascal.org (bugs, developer related qs)
e-mail: fpc-pascal@lists.freepascal.org (general pascal related qs)

Both these adresses are for mailing lists. If you're not subscribed,
be sure to mention this fact when sending questions to these lists,
so that people sending answers know about it and send you a copy.
Information about available lists and subscription can be found
on http://lists.freepascal.org/mailman/listinfo

(several mirrors exist, see website for links)

Additional information about mailing lists, news, future plans etc.
can be found on the web site.

SNAPSHOTS & SOURCES
-------------------
One of the features of FPC is the snapshots. These are made daily or weekly
from the developers' latest versions of the source. Snapshots are available
for the GO32v2, Win32, OS/2 and Linux versions of the compiler/rtl.

You will also normally find in the snapshot archive file a readme, with
a note about the latest included changes. It is quite common, though it doesn't
always happen, that when a bug is reported it is fixed and a fixed version
can be obtained the NEXT day in the appropriate snapshot.... yes really!

Also on the ftp site you'll find a /dist directory, with the latest
distributed releases, a /docs directory, and a /source directory, in
which every night at about 0100 GMT the latest source generated by the
developers during the day & evening before is exported from CVS
into ZIP files eg compiler.zip, rtl.zip, base.zip etc.


Making your own snapshots
-------------------------
By downloading the /source files (makefiles are included)
it is possible to to make your own version of the fpc compiler/rtl
and to modify it. You are of course free to do this
so long as you observe the licence conditions. In order to make the
compiler/rtl & ides in a resonable time (eg <30 minutes) you'll need at least
32M of physical memory (64M is better) memory and at least a 200 Mhz processor
and at least 20 Mbytes of free disk space. You'll also need
some knowledge of making files & programming... it is not
difficult but it isn't easy either!

REPORTING BUGS
----------------
If you find a bug in the released version, you may want to try a snapshot
(see SNAPSHOTS above) to see if it has been fixed before reporting it to
the fpc-devel mailing list.

If you find a fault or 'feature' in a release, please report it
to the fpc-devel mailing list. PLEASE SEND ALSO A SMALL EXTRACT OF THE SOURCE
CODE which caused the problem, and state the version eg Win32, GO32v2,
and the date of the compiler etc on which you noticed the problem & any other
useful info so the developers can reproduce the problem, otherwise they may
not be willing/able to fix it.
