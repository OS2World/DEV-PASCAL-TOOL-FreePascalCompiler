1 FreeBSD supported versions and status 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1 Supported FreeBSD versions.
==========================

- Supported are FreeBSD 4.x only, though 5.x seems to work according to some.
  I'm waiting for the 5.x ISO beta snapshot to verify that.

   3.x (3.2, 3.4) used to work, until signalhandling was introduced. Since
   that time my only 3.x testing account vanished, so :-)

1.2 Status
==========================

FPC/FreeBSD is now in use for over a year now, and I never heard or
experienced problems that caused dataloss and only rarely a crash (usually
when fiddling with the copro registers and with the restarting of exceptions )

2 Known bugs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Clone is not very well tested, and I had a bugreport that there were problems 
   with it.

- Recovering from integer divide by zero seems to go ok, but then it hangs
  again in the next one. I've been trying to fix this for weeks, but haven't
   succeeded yet.

- More readdir problems have been fixed (and the last one was one that only
  occured under rare circumstances). So now that should be fixed. I don't
  know how good my readdir is, ( Libc does some complex scanning and sorting
  for duplicate names, but I don't know if that is something archaic or not. 

- Most packages have been rougly or even fairly well tested, but I can't
- guarantee to have tested everything.

3 implemented Syscalls/linux unit functions
-----------
The bulk of the functions in unit linux are implemented.

ipc(unit)  The IPC is System V thingy, and only supported under FreeBSD with
                          certain kernel parameters.

Clone()    Not implemented as syscall, based on linuxthread assembler
            routine. Untested. Somebody has a good test program? Or that
            tests the FCL threading routines based on it?

sysinfo  NI noreq       Not supported under BSD, not even by emulator
uname    NI noreq       "        "       "    "   "   "    "   "
                        (procedures based on this call are also commented
                         (get* procs)) (sysctl code is still in the works)
