\chapter{The KEYBOARD unit}
\FPCexampledir{kbdex}

The \file{KeyBoard} unit implements a keyboard access layer which is system
independent. It can be used to poll the keyboard state and wait for certain
events. Waiting for a keyboard event can be done with the \seef{GetKeyEvent}
function, which will return a driver-dependent key event. This key event can
be translated to a interpretable event by the \seef{TranslateKeyEvent}
function. The result of this function can be used in the other event
examining functions.

A custom keyboard driver can be installed using the \seef{SetKeyboardDriver}
function. The current keyboard driver can be retrieved using the
\seep{GetKeyboardDriver} function. The last section of this chapter
demonstrates how to make a keyboard driver.

\section{Constants, Type and variables }

\subsection{Constants}

The following constants define some error constants, which may be returned
by the keyboard functions.
\begin{verbatim}
errKbdBase           = 1010;
errKbdInitError      = errKbdBase + 0;
errKbdNotImplemented = errKbdBase + 1;
\end{verbatim}
The following constants denote special keyboard keys. The first constants
denote the function keys:
\begin{verbatim}
const
  kbdF1        = $FF01;
  kbdF2        = $FF02;
  kbdF3        = $FF03;
  kbdF4        = $FF04;
  kbdF5        = $FF05;
  kbdF6        = $FF06;
  kbdF7        = $FF07;
  kbdF8        = $FF08;
  kbdF9        = $FF09;
  kbdF10       = $FF0A;
  kbdF11       = $FF0B;
  kbdF12       = $FF0C;
  kbdF13       = $FF0D;
  kbdF14       = $FF0E;
  kbdF15       = $FF0F;
  kbdF16       = $FF10;
  kbdF17       = $FF11;
  kbdF18       = $FF12;
  kbdF19       = $FF13;
  kbdF20       = $FF14;
\end{verbatim}
Constants  \$15 till \$1F are reserved for future function keys. The
following constants denote the cursor movement keys:
\begin{verbatim}
  kbdHome      = $FF20;
  kbdUp        = $FF21;
  kbdPgUp      = $FF22;
  kbdLeft      = $FF23;
  kbdMiddle    = $FF24;
  kbdRight     = $FF25;
  kbdEnd       = $FF26;
  kbdDown      = $FF27;
  kbdPgDn      = $FF28;

  kbdInsert    = $FF29;
  kbdDelete    = $FF2A;
\end{verbatim}
Constants \$2B till \$2F are reserved for future keypad keys.
The following flags are also defined:
\begin{verbatim}
  kbASCII       = $00;
  kbUniCode     = $01;
  kbFnKey       = $02;
  kbPhys        = $03;
  kbReleased    = $04;
\end{verbatim}
They can be used to check what kind of data a key event contains.
The following shift-state flags can be used to determine the shift state of
a key (i.e. which of the SHIFT, ALT and CTRL keys were pressed
simultaneously with a key):
\begin{verbatim}
  kbLeftShift   = 1;
  kbRightShift  = 2;
  kbShift       = kbLeftShift or kbRightShift;
  kbCtrl        = 4;
  kbAlt         = 8;
\end{verbatim}
The following constant strings are used in the key name functions 
\seef{FunctionKeyName} and \seef{KeyEventToString}:
\begin{verbatim}
SShift       : Array [1..3] of string[5] = ('SHIFT','CTRL','ALT');
LeftRight   : Array [1..2] of string[5] = ('LEFT','RIGHT');
UnicodeChar : String = 'Unicode character ';
SScanCode    : String = 'Key with scancode ';
SUnknownFunctionKey : String = 'Unknown function key : ';
SAnd         : String = 'AND';
SKeyPad      : Array [0..($FF2F-kbdHome)] of string[6] = 
               ('Home','Up','PgUp','Left',
                'Middle','Right','End','Down',
                'PgDn','Insert','Delete','',
                '','','','');
\end{verbatim}
They can be changed to localize the key names when needed.

\subsection{Types}
The \var{TKeyEvent} type is the base type for all keyboard events:
\begin{verbatim}
  TKeyEvent = Longint;
\end{verbatim}
The key stroke is encoded in the 4 bytes of the \var{TKeyEvent} type. 
The various fields of the key stroke encoding can be obtained by typecasting
the \var{TKeyEvent} type to the \var{TKeyRecord} type:
\begin{verbatim}
  TKeyRecord = packed record
    KeyCode : Word;
    ShiftState, Flags : Byte;
  end;
\end{verbatim}
The structure of a \var{TKeyRecord} structure is explained in \seet{keyevent}.
\begin{FPCltable}{lp{10cm}}{Structure of TKeyRecord}{keyevent}
Field & Meaning \\ \hline
KeyCode & Depending on \var{flags} either the physical representation of a key
         (under DOS scancode, ascii code pair), or the translated
           ASCII/unicode character.\\
ShiftState & Shift-state when this key was pressed (or shortly after) \\
Flags & Determine how to interpret \var{KeyCode} \\ \hline
\end{FPCltable}
The shift-state can be checked using the various shift-state constants, 
and the flags in the last byte can be checked using one of the
kbASCII, kbUniCode, kbFnKey, kbPhys, kbReleased constants.

If there are two keys returning the same char-code, there's no way to find
out which one was pressed (Gray+ and Simple+). If it needs to be known which
was pressed, the untranslated keycodes must be used, but these are system
dependent. System dependent constants may be defined to cover those, with
possibily having the same name (but different value).

The \var{TKeyboardDriver} record can be used to install a custom keyboard
driver with the \seef{SetKeyboardDriver} function:
\begin{verbatim}
Type 
  TKeyboardDriver = Record
    InitDriver : Procedure;
    DoneDriver : Procedure;
    GetKeyEvent : Function : TKeyEvent;
    PollKeyEvent : Function : TKeyEvent;
    GetShiftState : Function : Byte;
    TranslateKeyEvent : Function (KeyEvent: TKeyEvent): TKeyEvent;
    TranslateKeyEventUniCode: Function (KeyEvent: TKeyEvent): TKeyEvent;
  end;
\end{verbatim}
The various fields correspond to the different functions of the keyboard unit 
interface. For more information about this record see \sees{kbddriver}

\section{Functions and Procedures}

\begin{procedure}{DoneKeyboard}
\Declaration
Procedure DoneKeyboard;
\Description
\var{DoneKeyboard} de-initializes the keyboard interface if the keyboard
driver is active. If the keyboard driver is not active, the function does
nothing.

This will cause the keyboard driver to clear up any allocated memory, 
or restores the console or terminal the program was running in to its 
initial state before the call to \seep{InitKeyBoard}. This function should 
be called on program exit. Failing to do so may leave the terminal or
console window in an unusable state. Its exact action depends on the 
platform on which the program is running.
\Errors
None.
\SeeAlso
\seep{InitKeyBoard}
\end{procedure}

For an example, see most other functions.

\begin{function}{FunctionKeyName}
\Declaration
Function FunctionKeyName (KeyCode : Word) : String;
\Description
\var{FunctionKeyName} returns a string representation of the function key
with code \var{KeyCode}. This can be an actual function key, or one of the
cursor movement keys.
\Errors
In case \var{KeyCode} does not contain a function code, the
\var{SUnknownFunctionKey} string is returned, appended with the
\var{KeyCode}.

\end{function}

No example available yet.

\section{Keyboard scan codes}
Special physical keys are encoded with the DOS scan codes for these keys
in the second byte of the \var{TKeyEvent} type.
A complete list of scan codes can be found in \seet{keyscans}. This is the
list of keys that is used by the default key event translation mechanism.
When writing a keyboard driver, either these constants should be returned
by the various key event functions, or the \var{TranslateKeyEvent} hook
should be implemented by the driver.
\begin{FPCltable}{llllll}{Physical keys scan codes}{keyscans}
Code & Key & Code & Key & Code & Key\\ \hline
\input{keys.tex}
\hline
\end{FPCltable}
A list of scan codes for special keys and combinations with the SHIFT, ALT
and CTRL keys can be found in \seet{speckeys}; They are for quick reference
only.
\begin{FPCltable}{llccc}{Special keys scan codes}{speckeys}
Key         & Code  & SHIFT-Key & CTRL-Key & Alt-Key \\ \hline

\section{Writing a keyboard driver}
\label{se:kbddriver}
Writing a keyboard driver means that hooks must be created for most of the 
keyboard unit functions. The \var{TKeyBoardDriver} record contains a field
for each of the possible hooks:
\begin{verbatim}
TKeyboardDriver = Record
  InitDriver : Procedure;
  DoneDriver : Procedure;
  GetKeyEvent : Function : TKeyEvent;
  PollKeyEvent : Function : TKeyEvent;
  GetShiftState : Function : Byte;
  TranslateKeyEvent : Function (KeyEvent: TKeyEvent): TKeyEvent;
  TranslateKeyEventUniCode: Function (KeyEvent: TKeyEvent): TKeyEvent;
end;
\end{verbatim}
The meaning of these hooks is explained below:
\begin{description}
\item[InitDriver] Called to initialize and enable the driver. 
Guaranteed to be called only once. This should initialize all needed things
for the driver.
\item[DoneDriver] Called to disable and clean up the driver. Guaranteed to be
called after a call to \var{initDriver}. This should clean up all
things initialized by \var{InitDriver}.
\item[GetKeyEvent] Called by \seef{GetKeyEvent}. Must wait for and return the
next key event. It should NOT store keys.
\item[PollKeyEvent] Called by \seef{PollKeyEvent}. It must return the next key
event if there is one. Should not store keys. 
\item[GetShiftState] Called by \seef{PollShiftStateEvent}.  Must return the current
shift state.
\item[TranslateKeyEvent] Should translate a raw key event to a cOrrect
key event, i.e. should fill in the shiftstate and convert function key
scancodes to function key keycodes. If the
\var{TranslateKeyEvent} is not filled in, a default translation function
will be called which converts the known scancodes from the tables in the
previous section to a correct keyevent.
\item[TranslateKeyEventUniCode] Should translate a key event to a unicode key
representation. 
\end{description}
Strictly speaking, only the \var{GetKeyEvent} and \var{PollKeyEvent}
hooks must be implemented for the driver to function correctly. 

The following unit demonstrates how a keyboard driver can be installed.
It takes the installed driver, and hooks into the \var{GetKeyEvent}
function to register and log the key events in a file. This driver
can work on top of any other driver, as long as it is inserted in the 
\var{uses} clause {\em after} the real driver unit, and the real driver unit
should set the driver record in its initialization section.
\FPCexample{logkeys}
The following program demonstrates the use of the unit:
\FPCexample{ex9}
Note that with a simple extension of this unit could be used to make a
driver that is capable of recording and storing a set of keyboard strokes,
and replaying them at a later time, so a 'keyboard macro' capable driver.
This driver could sit on top of any other driver.
