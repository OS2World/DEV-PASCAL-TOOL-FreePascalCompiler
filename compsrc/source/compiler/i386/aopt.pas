 - renamefest!

 Revision 1.1.2.1  2000/12/05 09:55:08  jonas
   - removed all newoptimizations stuff since it will never be active under
     1.0.x anyway

 Revision 1.1  2000/07/13 06:29:44  michael
 + Initial import

 Revision 1.32  2000/02/09 13:22:44  peter
   * log truncated

 Revision 1.31  2000/01/07 01:14:19  peter
   * updated copyright to 2000

 Revision 1.30  1999/11/27 23:50:22  jonas
   + if you define "newOptimizations", all extra optimizations that
     require conditional defines will be activated (ie., it's equivalent
     to "-dreplacereg -darithopt -dforopt -dfoldarithops")

 Revision 1.29  1999/10/23 14:44:24  jonas
   * finally got around making GetNextInstruction return false when
     the current pai object is a AsmBlockStart marker
   * changed a loop in aopt386 which was incompatible with this change
